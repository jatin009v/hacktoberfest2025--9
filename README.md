How it works under the hood 🧩
- Structure and data flow:
  - The UI is built with HTML and SCSS for a clean, responsive layout.
  - JavaScript handles data input, code generation, and rendering.
  - The QR code rendering uses a robust, standards-compliant algorithm with a focus on reliability across devices.
  - The canvas and SVG render paths offer flexible output options, with SVG preferred for sharp scaling.
- Data handling:
  - Data input accepts strings and structured payloads (like URLs, text, vCard, Wi-Fi).
  - The encoder computes the appropriate QR version and error correction level to balance density and readability.
  - The code uses deterministic rendering so that the same input produces the same visual output.
- Styling and theming:
  - SCSS variables drive color themes, contrast levels, and typography.
  - Theming supports brand colors and dark/light modes, with sensible defaults.
- Asset pipeline:
  - Static assets are bundled for fast load times.
  - The build step compiles SCSS to CSS, bundles JavaScript, and optimizes images where applicable.

Data input and QR parameters 📦
- Data payloads:
  - URL: Enter a web address; the QR code will encode the URL so scanners can open it directly.
  - Text: Any plain text data that you want to share.
  - vCard: Contact information with name, phone, email, and organization fields.
  - Wi-Fi: SSID and password for quick-network sharing scenarios.
  - Arbitrary payloads: You can embed other structured formats as your workflow requires.
- Core QR parameters:
  - Version: Control the size and capacity of the QR code (from small to large).
  - Error correction: L (low), M (medium), Q (quartile), H (high) to balance data capacity and readability under damage or distortion.
  - Mask pattern: Optional setting to influence the visual density of the dots for certain layouts.
  - Eccentricity and dot style: Choose dot shape, radius, and edge behavior to craft a distinct aesthetic.
- Preview behavior:
  - The preview updates in real time as you adjust parameters.
  - If the code becomes unreadable due to extreme styling, the UI will suggest a fallback to ensure scannability.

Customization options in depth 🎨
- Color and contrast:
  - Foreground color: Pick any color for the dots and finder pattern.
  - Background: Transparent, solid color, gradient, or custom texture.
  - Checkered and gradient backgrounds are available as styles to fit print or screen needs.
- Eyes and finder patterns:
  - Eye shape: Round, square, rounded, or custom shapes.
  - Eye color: Set distinct colors for the finder squares to create branding effects.
- Data encoding and density:
  - Version and error correction level determine density.
  - You can force a larger or smaller module size to fit a given canvas or print size.
- Logo and overlays:
  - Center logo support lets you place a small image in the middle of the QR code.
  - Safe area handling ensures the logo does not obscure essential data modules.
- Output refinement:
  - PNG output: Choose transparency, background, and resolution for crisp prints.
  - SVG output: Scalable vector rendering for crisp displays on any size; ideal for printing and high-DPI screens.
  - Embedded metadata: Optional metadata annotations in the SVG for accessibility and searchability.
- Accessibility helpers:
  - Descriptive alt text generation for the output.
  - Keyboard shortcuts to focus input, generate, and download.
  - High-contrast presets to meet accessibility standards.
